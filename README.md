# Creating an Intelligent Agent for Database Queries with Azure OpenAI

This repo is about developing an agent to query a database containing product sales data.

The goal is to create an agent that can engage in fluid and continuous conversation with the user, and, when requested, generate and execute SQL queries on the database. 

Azure OpenAI will be used to power the application. The tutorial will guide you through creating the cloud resource, deployment, and saving the necessary information for integration with the Semantic Kernel.
