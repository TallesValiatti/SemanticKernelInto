# Creating an Intelligent Agent for Database Queries with Azure OpenAI

This repo demonstrates the implementation of an intelligent agent designed to query a database containing product sales data.

The agent is built to engage in fluid and continuous conversation with users, dynamically generating and executing SQL queries on the database as needed. Powered by Azure OpenAI, the agent leverages advanced natural language processing to understand user intents and translate them into precise database operations.

The implementation integrates the Semantic Kernel, ensuring the agent can perform context-aware interactions and efficiently manage complex queries within a .NET environment. This setup showcases how to build conversational AI that seamlessly interacts with structured data.
